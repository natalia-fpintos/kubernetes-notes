# Part 3: Introduction to Kubernetes

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an __orchestrator__ for __microservice__ apps that run on __containers__.

A microservice app in Kubernetes would be made of multiple services (components), each of them packaged as a k8s __pod__.
Kubernetes organises them so that they can work together, this is known as __orchestration__.
